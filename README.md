# vui-chee.github.io

The actual site is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

It is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I've decided to use the free domain that GitHub provides ðŸ˜… rather than rolling my own,
and I am redirecting people to my deployment at Vercel.

That way, I get to host my site for free and keep the code secret ðŸ¤«.
