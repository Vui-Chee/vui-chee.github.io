# vui-chee.github.io

The actual site is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

It is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I decide to use the free domain that Github pages provides ðŸ˜… rather than rolling my own domain,
and simply redirect to my deployment at Vercel.

That way, I get to host my site for free and keep the code secret ðŸ¤«.
