# vui-chee.github.io

The actual site is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Built from scratch with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
No custom templates, such as Gatsby or Jekyll, are used.

I've decided to use the free domain that GitHub provides ðŸ˜… rather than rolling my own,
and I am redirecting people to my deployment at Vercel.

That way, I get to host my site for free and keep the code secret ðŸ¤«.

### Future Customization

The pages for each post are not created from Markdown documents.
Each post can have its own custom feel and look, as the application
layout allows for flexible UI customization.
